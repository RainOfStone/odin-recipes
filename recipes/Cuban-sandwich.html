      <li>12 sandwich-sliced refrigerated kosher dill pickles, such as Claussen Kosher Dill Sandwich Slices</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Steps</h1>
      <ol>
        <li><p>Prepare pork shoulder: Add onion, garlic, orange juice, lime juice, 
        cumin, oregano, black pepper, and salt into a food processor or blender 
        and process until smooth.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place pork in the bottom of a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or large 
          baking dish and cut 3 or 4 large deep slits in the meat. 
          Pour marinade over pork, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator 4 hours or overnight.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place Dutch oven with prepared pork, covered, in the oven and set 
          the temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). 
          Bake until pork is very tender, 3 to 4 hours. Remove from the oven; 
          rest 15 minutes. Remove pork to a cutting board. Skim any fat from the cooking liquid, 
          and set cooking liquid aside.</p></li>
        <li><p>Shred pork with two forks, and discard any remaining fat and bone. Return pork to the pot, and add cooking liquid back into meat as needed to moisten.</p></li>
        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Heat a large skillet over medium heat.</p></li>
        <li><p>Spread about 2 tablespoons softened butter over cut sides of bread and place bread, buttered sides down, in skillet. Cook until buttered side is lightly browned and toasted, about 3 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Stir mustard and mayonnaise together in a small bowl. Spread about 2 teaspoons mustard mixture over bottom halves of bread and top with 1 slice of cheese, tearing as needed to fit the bread without 
          hanging over the edges. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, add about 1/2 cup shredded pork to each sandwich, draining off any excess liquid. Top each evenly with ham, 3 pickle slices, and 1 cheese slice. 
          Spread remaining mustard mixture evenly over top pieces of bread and place on top.</p></li>
        <li><p>Reheat the skillet over medium heat. Spread about 1 tablespoon butter lightly on the outsides of the 4 bottom buns. Working 2 sandwiches at a time, place sandwiches, buttered side down, in skillet. 
          Place 1 or 2 heavy-bottomed skillets on top of sandwiches to weigh them down. Cook until toasted and lightly golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove weighted skillets.</p></li>
        <li><p>Spread remaining 1 tablespoon butter over the 4 top halves of sandwiches, flip and press with weighted skillets again until toasted. Remove the first 2 sandwiches from skillet; 
          repeat the toasting process with remaining sandwiches. Cut sandwiches in halves and serve immediately.</p></li>
